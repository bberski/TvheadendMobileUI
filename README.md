Tvheadend mobile web interface

## Introduction

This is a mobile web interface for the Tvheadend streaming/recording server {http://www.tvheadend.org/}. You need a current version of Tvheadend (4.1).

It uses the framework iUI {http://www.iui-js.org/}, which provides an iPhone-like look and feel. It works on different modern browsers
